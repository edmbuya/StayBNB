## Free Plan Limits
- EmailJS free plan allows 200 emails per month
- This should be sufficient for most small to medium BnB operations
- If you need more, you can upgrade to a paid plan

## Troubleshooting
- If emails don't arrive, check your spam folder
- Verify all IDs are correctly entered in the code
- Check the browser console for any error messages
- Make sure your Gmail account is properly connected in EmailJS

## Security Note
Your email notifications are secure and will only be sent when someone completes a legitimate booking through your website.
